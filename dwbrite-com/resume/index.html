            I'm a generalist software developer with a specialization in backend / web development.
            Most of my personal projects are explorations into other domains like
            embedded firmware, rendering, or other physical crafts.

                    At ProGlove I was a core developer of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRUhZHi1rVI">ProGlove Insight</a> -
                    a cloud-based platform for IoT device management built on AWS.
                    Insight enables analysis of scans from ProGlove devices,

                    As one of only two programmers who worked on Insight from the start,

                    as well as in the interviewing and subsequent hiring of four additional team members.

                    After years of using <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html">Teensy development boards</a>, I wanted to dig into their inner workings.
                    In 2019 I started writing firmware from scratch for the Teensy 3's K20DX256 microcontroller,
                    and later teamed up with a programmer from France who had started working on some firmware of their own.

                    involved reading much of the K20DX256's 1400 page reference manual,
                    writing linker files, implementing registers and abstract device functionality,
                    and creating examples and documentation.
                    In the future we'd like to revisit the project with SVD-based code generation.

                    This project is split into two parts: the CLI, and the daemon.
                    The daemon is a long-running service that watches a release directory,
                    listens for commands via named pipes, and controls routing to a green or blue service.
                    The CLI merely sets up SystemD Unit files when you register an application,
                    and writes commands to the relevant named pipe.

                While I was experimenting with my custom game engine for a 2D game called <a href="https://github.com/dwbrite/void-rs">void</a>,
                I wanted to figure out
                a.) how to build my render graph, and
                b.) how to effectively render thousands of <i>unique</i> sprites.
            </p>

            <p>
                In an attempt to resolve those questions, I made a
                <a href="https://github.com/dwbrite/wgpu-particle-demo/">particle rendering demo</a>
                which draws and updates hundreds of thousands of individual particles every frame.
                Learning to make a renderer like this involved understanding low-level graphics APIs,
                writing compute, vertex, and fragment shaders in WGSL (and previously GLSL),
                and asking for <i>plenty</i> of help from niche online communities.

                    The projects listed above were all done in <b>Rust</b>,
                    mostly because I feel it allows me to write code quickly and with proper abstractions.
                    I started learning Rust in 2017 and haven't looked back since.
                    I've even contributed to the Rust by Example book and written blog posts about my favorite features.

                    by attempting to rebase within the Jetbrains GUI,
                    I've become <i>well</i>-acquainted with the CLI.

                    My operating system of choice since 2016 has been debian-based distros of <b>Linux</b>.
                    I dual-boot <b>Windows</b> on my desktop
                    and make an effort to ensure my projects compile on both platforms.

                <p>
                    As for CI/CD, these days I use <b>Github Actions</b> - though I've used both <b>Jenkins</b> and <b>Travis CI</b> in the past.

                    I worked with <b>AWS</b> at ProGlove and
                    I'm familiar with a large portion of its services, namely Lambda, IoT Core, API Gateway, and SQS.
                    More often, I tend to use <b>Linode</b>'s virtual private servers for my personal projects.

                    I'm pretty quick to learn, so don't be afraid to ask for technologies that aren't listed here.
                    I'm particularly interested in learning Scala, Kubernetes, or Ansible should the opportunity ever arise.

            <br/>
            I started writing software in my first year of high school,
            and learned quickly by participating in CTF tournaments, going to game jams, and working on personal projects every summer.
            My early work involved writing small games and applications in Java using in awt and javafx.
            I also wrote some mathematical libraries for geometry, collision detection,
            and a LargeDecimal implementation for the <a href="https://unlicense.developpez.com/">UN</a> project.
            I <del>pirated</del> read a <em>lot</em> of programming books at this time, namely Real-Time Rendering and Effective Java (2nd Edition).

            <b><time datetime="2016">2016</time> - <time datetime="2018">2018</time></b>
            <br/>
            Out of high school I attended community college and started using git more seriously.
            I explored simple rendering with Java OpenGL bindings, and moved towards Kotlin
            instead of relying on a dozen <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">tools to make idiomatic Java more bearable.</a>
            On top of Kotlin, Rust had been on my radar since it hit 1.0 in 2015, and I finally started learning it in 2017.
            I've been a big fan ever since,
            so much that I've even <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example/pull/920">contributed</a> to the
            <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/primitives.html">Rust by Example</a> book.
            I picked up some C++ in my coursework too.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b><time datetime="2019">2019</time> - <time datetime="2021">Present</time></b>
            <br/>
            At the end of 2018 I wrote a small web server in Go to run my website on,
            which equipped me for an impromptu interview for a backend development intern at a company that just so happened to use Go.
            I had been looking for co-ops to complete my degree, so it was really perfect timing on all parts.
            This was probably my slowest but most prolific software development period,
            where I delved into embedded firmware development in Rust and C++, and rendering with the cross-platform rendering API <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu">wgpu</a>.
            But more importantly,
            I learned how <em>not</em> to turn <a href="https://twitter.com/HenryHoffman/status/694184106440200192/photo/1">git into guitar hero</a>.
