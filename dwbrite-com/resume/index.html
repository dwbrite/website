            I'm a generalist software developer with a specialization in backend / web architecture.
            Most of my personal projects are explorations into other domains like
            embedded firmware (<a href="https://github.com/irevoire/teensy/pull/5">rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dwbrite/lightboard-controls">c++</a>),
            rendering (<a href="https://github.com/dwbrite/wgpu-rendering-project/wiki">in theory</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dwbrite/void-rs/blob/master/game/src/graphics/mod.rs">in practice</a>),

                    At ProGlove I was a core developer of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRUhZHi1rVI">ProGlove Insight</a> -
                    a cloud-based platform for <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> device management built on AWS.
                    Insight enables analysis of scans from ProGlove devices,

                    As one of only two programmers who worked on Insight from the start,

                    as well as in the interviewing and subsequent hiring of four additional team members.

        Experience Points (xp) is a heuristic for quantifying relative experience.
        I've used 20,000xp as a baseline equivalent to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">Malcolm Gladwell's</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20121114-gladwells-10000-hour-rule-myth">10,000 hours</a>.
        Note that 2xp ≠ 1 hr in much that same way that 1 agile story point ≠ 1 man-day. XP is also relative to the <em>size</em> of the subject.
        For example, I've used Linux longer than I've used Rust, but I've mastered more of Rust than I have of Linux.

            <br/>
            I started writing software in my first year of high school,
            and learned quickly by participating in CTF tournaments, going to game jams, and working on personal projects every summer.
            My early work involved writing small games and applications in Java using in awt and javafx.
            I also wrote some mathematical libraries for geometry, collision detection,
            and a LargeDecimal implementation for the <a href="https://unlicense.developpez.com/">UN</a> project.
            I <del>pirated</del> read a <em>lot</em> of programming books at this time, namely Real-Time Rendering and Effective Java (2nd Edition).
        </p>

        <p>
            <b><time datetime="2016">2016</time> - <time datetime="2018">2018</time></b>
            <br/>
            Out of high school I attended community college and started using git more seriously.
            I explored simple rendering with Java OpenGL bindings, and moved towards Kotlin
            instead of relying on a dozen <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">tools to make idiomatic Java more bearable.</a>
            On top of Kotlin, Rust had been on my radar since it hit 1.0 in 2015, and I finally started learning it in 2017.
            I've been a big fan ever since,
            so much that I've even <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example/pull/920">contributed</a> to the
            <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/primitives.html">Rust by Example</a> book.
            I picked up some C++ in my coursework too.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b><time datetime="2019">2019</time> - <time datetime="2021">Present</time></b>
            <br/>
            At the end of 2018 I wrote a small web server in Go to run my website on,
            which equipped me for an impromptu interview for a backend development intern at a company that just so happened to use Go.
            I had been looking for co-ops to complete my degree, so it was really perfect timing on all parts.
            This was probably my slowest but most prolific software development period,
            where I delved into embedded firmware development in Rust and C++, and rendering with the cross-platform rendering API <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu">wgpu</a>.
            But more importantly,
            I learned how <em>not</em> to turn <a href="https://twitter.com/HenryHoffman/status/694184106440200192/photo/1">git into guitar hero</a>.
