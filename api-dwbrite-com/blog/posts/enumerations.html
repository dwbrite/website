<p>
Ever since I started learning Rust about 4 years ago, I've been in love with its enums.
You see, Rust's enums aren't strictly enumerations.
They're closer to <i>tagged unions</i> or <i>sum types</i>, which are used to represent variants.
Let's take a look at what an enum <em>is</em>, and a few cool use-cases for them.
</p>

<details>
<summary>About enums & A comparison to tagged unions in C</summary>
<p>You should already be familiar with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_type">unions</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type">traditional enums</a>.
</p>

<p>
Rust's enums are something of a mix between the two.<br/>
You can read up on the basics in
<i><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html?highlight=enum#enum-values">the book</a></i> and/or
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/custom_types/enum.html">Rust by Example</a>.<br/>
That said, let's look at a simple enum in Rust and how it might be implemented in C.
<script type="text/plain" class="language-rust"
>// example enum in Rust
enum FooBar {
    A(i16),
    B(i32),
    C,
}
</script>

<script type="text/plain" class="language-c"
>// rough implementation of FooBar as a tagged union

enum Foo { A, B, C };

union Bar {
    short a;
    int b;
};

struct FooBar {
    Foo tag; // the tag allows us to know which variant our data is.
    Bar data;
};
</script>
</p>

<p>
Note that Rust's enums share the same span of memory between its constituent types,
so only a small amount of memory is wasted.
You can play around with their internal representations in
<a href="https://play.integer32.com/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=20ae3a196d6a69ad0f2e98b3c01cde1e">this playground</a>,

<h3>error handling with variants</h3>

<p>Two particularly useful <q>enums</q> are <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code>.</p>

<p>
<code>Result</code> gives you a way to represent whether an operation is successful or not,
as well as a way to access the data or error of the... result. ðŸ‘€
</p>

<p>
<code>Option</code> gives you a way to represent whether something exists or not.
This is generally used as a replacement for nullable types
(which Rust does not have<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/index.html">*</a>).
</p>

<p>
But what really makes Rust shine is that it forces you to <em>explicitly</em> handle enum variants before you can access the underlying data.
This is done using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-02-match.html">the <code>match</code> keyword</a>.
Rust also has <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/error-handling-and-panics/the-question-mark-operator-for-easier-error-handling.html">special syntax</a>
for handling Results and Options when you raise issues from the unhappy path.
</p>

<p>
To start, let's compare how we handle a simple http endpoint with Go's <code>gorilla/mux</code> and Rust's <code>Rocket</code>.
</p>

<p>Rust:
<script type="text/plain" class="language-rust"
>#[get("/blog/post/<title>")]
fn blog_post(title: &RawStr, state: State<BlogState>) -> Result<Template, CustomError> {
    // `?` is syntactic sugar for propagating errors.
    // url_decode() can fail, and returns a Result when it does.
    // if url_decode() does fail, Rust will return Err(CustomError) for us,
    // (assuming that we've provided a type conversion with From)

    let key = title.url_decode()?; // <- error propagation
    let post = state.title_map.get(key.as_str())?; // <- more error propagation

    let c = Context {
        title: "Devin's Blog".to_string(),
        posts: vec![post.clone()],
    };

    Ok(Template::render("blog", &c))
}
</script>
</p>


<p>Go:
<script type="text/plain" class="language-go rainbow-braces"
>// routed from "/blog/post/{title}"
func (bs BlogState) ServeBlogPost(writer http.ResponseWriter, request *http.Request) {
    key := mux.Vars(request)["title"]
    post, ok := bs.TitleMap[key]
    if !ok {
        http.Error(writer, "blog post not found", http.StatusBadRequest)
		return
    }

	ctx := Context{
        title: "Devin's Blog",
        posts: make([]BlogPost, post),
	}

	err := bs.Template.Execute(writer, ctx)
	if err != nil {
        http.Error(writer, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
	}
}
</script>
</p>

<p>
By having data embedded into variants, we can represent whether an operation is successful or not.
Potential errors can be propagated, transformed, and handled without mucking up your happy path.
</p>

<p>
Very cool. ðŸ˜Ž
</p>

<p>
Let's go deeper.
</p>


<h3>heap allocation and dynamic dispatch</h3>

<p>
Imagine you're writing an audio system for a game.
You have a directed acyclic graph and you need a way to represent the nodes in this graph.
A node can be an input (sine wave, mp3), effect (pan, mix), or output (speakers, a file, visualizer).
</p>

<p>
What all nodes have in common is one function: <code>process(inputs, outputs)</code>.
Let's call this common behaviour the <code>AudioNode</code> interface (or <i>trait</i>).
</p>

<p>
So our audio graph looks something like <code>Graph&lt;AudioNode&gt;</code>.<br/>
In practice then, each node in the graph is <i>dynamically sized</i> and must be heap allocated.
To <em>perform</em> that heap allocation in Rust, our nodes must be wrapped in a smart pointer:
<code>Box&lt;dyn AudioNode&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
Then the <code>process(..)</code> function needs to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch">dynamically dispatched</a>.
</p>

<p>
All this results in significant overhead with multiple vtable accesses, and more importantly:
<em>indirection which prevents compiler optimization.</em>
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind <code>process(..)</code> is called <i>multiple thousands of times per second</i>.
</p>

<hr/>

<p>
But we can improve that with enums:
<script type="text/plain" class="language-rust rainbow-braces"
>// We can put all of our node variants inside of an enum.
// This allows our data to stay on the stack,
// improving cache locality and eschewing a heap allocation.
// Note however, that we *must* be careful with variant sizes,
// as any NodeVariant will take as much space on the stack as the largest variant.
pub enum NodeVariant {
    CpalOut(CpalMonoSink),
    SineIn(Sine),
    SquareIn(Square),
    SumFX(Sum),
    SlewLimFX(SlewLimiter),
}


// We end up manually implementing dynamic dispatch,
// but in a way which enables compiler optimization and reduces indirection.
impl AudioNode for NodeVariant {
    fn process(&mut self, inputs: &[Input], output: &mut [Buffer]) {
        match self {
            NodeVariant::CpalOut(s) => s.process(inputs, output),
            NodeVariant::SineIn(s) => s.process(inputs, output),
            NodeVariant::SquareIn(s) => s.process(inputs, output),
            NodeVariant::SumFX(s) => s.process(inputs, output),
            NodeVariant::SlewLimFX(s) => s.process(inputs, output),
        }
    }
}
</script>
</p>

<p>
In my project I'm getting <em>up to 10%</em> better performance.
Not at all laughable in audio programming.
You can remove a lot of boilerplate here with the <code>impl-enum</code> or <code>enum_dispatch</code> crates
(<a href="https://docs.rs/enum_dispatch/0.3.6/enum_dispatch/#the-benchmarks">see enum_dispatch benchmarks</a>).
</p>

<p>
Very, very cool. ðŸ˜Ž
</p>


<h3>message passing</h3>

<p>
Imagine you're writing a music player.
Your UI has controls for play/pause, seek, skip, etc.
These inputs can come from different places - like
<a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/#Interfaces">dbus</a>,
hotkeys, or simple UI interactions.
</p>

<p>
We've just run into an ideal use-case for <i>MPSC (multi-producer/single-consumer) channels</i>!
An <i>MPSC channel</i> is simply an <abbr title="meaning memory is shared across threads">atomic</abbr> queue
that can only be accessed through its <i>producers</i> and <i>consumers</i>.
</p>

<p>
Whenever one of the aforementioned controls are triggered,
we can send a message through an MPSC channel to <i>control</i> playback.
With that out of the way, we need to determine what data to send.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at some potential <i>Java-esque</i> solutions.
Normal enums won't work because <em>some</em> of our controls like <code>Seek(timestamp)</code> have associated data.
Maybe a class with an enum field, plus fields for each type of associated data would work?
Or a string?
</p>

<p>
It's an oddly gnarly problem to solve.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for us, Rust's enums make this easy.
This is part of what makes multithreading so nice in Rust.
</p>


<h3>closing thoughts</h3>

<p>
The last pattern using enums that I'd like to shine some light on is the <i>finite state machine</i>.
Plenty of others have written about <a href="https://hoverbear.org/blog/rust-state-machine-pattern/">state machines in Rust</a> before,
so I won't <a href="https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/state-machines/">reiterate</a> on that.
