i've fallen into a pattern of metaphorically losing my mind,
regaining it again, and then forgetting -
returning to a state of mere existence for months at a time.
</p>

<p>
you go from thought - and i mean real, genuine thought - ... <br/>
you go from genuine thought, and you become just a process. <br/>
you may still problem solve, interact with others, et cetera, et al, <br/>
but you live on autopilot.<br/>
<br/>
ask yourself: how often do you think about <i>what you're actually doing?</i>
</p>

<p>
<em>
where do you want to go? <br/>
how are you going to get there? <br/>
what are you actually doing? <br/>
</em>

<p title="i'm not trying to be vulgar or edgy here. it's just funny when you stop and think about it from an 'existential' perspective. like, hello! look at the bigger picture!">
<span>we live on some dumb rock flying through space.</span> <br/>
we're humans.<br/>
<strong>we live <em>because</em> we fuck.</strong> <br/>
--- stop and acknowledge that. --- <br/>
yet at least half of our waking lives (at work, university),<br/>
<i><q>procreation</q></i> is unspeakable.
</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>
and that's funny. maybe a little sad. <br/>
but that's not the point. <br/>
the <em>point</em> is that you have to put on a facade, day in and day out. <br/>
whether your facade is in regards to sex <br/>
or you're embarrassed about your immense plant collection. <br/>
you exist almost independent from your true self. <br/>
you think differently,
you behave differently, <br/>
you <em>live</em> on <em>autopilot.</em>
</p>

<p>
but sometimes, for a little while, you break out.

    when really, you're asleep in life's waiting room.

<p>
this is a reminder to wake up. <br/>
smell the flowers. <br/>
get back to doing what you <em>want</em> to do. <br/>
take that trip. <br/>
get that project done. <br/>
tell her how you really feel. <br/>
<em>take off that facade.</em>
</p>

<p>
don't let the world pass you by.
