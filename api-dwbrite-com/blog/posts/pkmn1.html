<p>It may not look like much but this is really exciting progress for me and this project.
    This is a Pokemon recreation I’m making with Slick2D/Java that I’ve been working on for the past two weeks.
    There’s no collisions or animations quite yet but those should be done within the next two days.</p>

<p>This game is a recreation of FR/LG that’s expanded to
    several other regions in a single story line including Hoenn, Johto, and Orre.
    The main goal is to have a “pure” Pokemon game in which all Pokemon can be found
    and there are no weird Dex restrictions
    (For example, not being able to evolve a Crobat in FR/LG before the national dex,
    or having game specific Pokemon like Vulpix or Bellsprout).</p>

<p>The biggest problem is leveling throughout regions.
    I think the best solution is to have a level lock until you beat certain gyms -
    similar to how traded Pokemon of a high level refuse to listen.</p>

<p>If you have any ideas send me an email and I’ll think about it.
    Remember to check my live update page for more information on what exactly is being done!</p>
