    Last week I was downvoted on reddit. My initial response, stealing the words of Barbara Kruger, is:
    <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/11/i-think-about-when-barbara-kruger-dragged-supreme-a-lot.html">what a ridiculous clusterfuck of totally uncool jokers.</a>
</p>

<p>
    So let's talk about licensing.
</p>

    <li>Yes, I'm probably wrong somewhere. Submit an issue on github.</li>
    <li>I'm looking for work. I've got sense, a propensity for architecture, and an affinity for types. Hire me ðŸ”«ðŸ‘€</li>

<p>
    To start, intellectual property is (self-descriptively) the ownership of ideas, information, inventions and creative works.
    We've come up with some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics">politics</a> to handle this ownership,
    namely through copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets.
    Different types of works may only be protected under specific ownership schemes.
</p>

// todo: put in an aside about "a copyright" / language.
// "A copyright" is the intellectual property - not the creative work itself.

<p>
    As soon as you've <em><q>fixed</q></em> a creative work, you own the exclusive rights to the reproduction,
    derivation, distribution, and display or performance of it.
    It is your intellectual property through copyright.
    After a limited time[1], the work falls into the public domain, where everyone has these (now non-exclusive) rights.
    Copyright specifically does not apply to ideas, processes, discoveries,
    titles, intangible works, simple lists -- only to the manifestation/expression of <q>creative work</q>.
    Things like [art, literature, code, or schematics], which are <em>more or less</em> original.
</p>

<p>
    What's really fun about copyright is that, while something like the design of a PCB or schematic is protected by copyright,
    the <q>functional</q> components of the designs are not.
    That is to say, it is <em>possible</em> to recreate the same circuits
    in a different shape without infringing any copyrights.
    Likewise for APIs, according to <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc.">Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.</a></i>!
    This is all thanks to <q>Fair Use</q> provisions, which (very loosely) define the circumstanced .
    The U.S. Copyright Office has <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/">an index of Fair Use decisions</a>, which is pretty cool ngl.
</p>

<p>
    Say you've created some art and published it, then someone starts selling prints of your art without your permission.
    Easy case, just sue, right? Well, registering your copyright is actually Very Fucking Important,
    because if you don't, <em>you can't sue someone copyright infringement</em>.
    Fortunately you can register at any time, even years after <q>fixing</q> your work.
</p>

<p>
    Now say you've registered your work at some point and filed a lawsuit for copyright infringement.
    Only if you've registered your work within three months of publication are you eligible for statutory damages, and attorney fees.
    If you register within five years, then the onus is on the defendant to prove those prints don't infringe your copyright.
    If you wait more than five years to register your work, then the onus is on you to prove your copyright in court.
</p>

<p>
    Oh yeah, and if your work changes, you need to register every version.
    <br/>
    Ideally within three months.
    <br/>
    Did you know that the copyright system was definitely not designed with software in mind?
    Did you also know that there have been major overhauls of it as recently 1989?
</p>

<h4 id="ch2-5-licensing"><a href="#ch-2-5-licensing">chapter two-point-five: licensing</a></h4>

<p>
    We're still talking about copyright.
</p>

<p>
    Besides suing people, copyright provisions allow you to authorize people to exercise your exclusive rights.
    This is typically done through licensing.
    The fun thing about licenses is that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-04-16-uk-game-retailer-claims-7-500-souls-with-a-legal-agreement-prank.html">they can literally say anything!</a>
    Whether or not they're enforceable is up to the courts.
</p>

<p>
    One particularly interesting copyright (<q>copyleft</q>) license is the GNU General Public License v3,
    which states that you can distribute and modify software using this license, but when you do so,
    it must be under the GPLv3+, and you must make the source code available.
</p>

<p>
    What I find most interesting about the GPL is that it enforces a specific license on new work (which is derivative).
</p>

<p>
    Some copyleft licenses, such as CC0 (Creative Commons Zero) and <a href="https://unlicense.org/">Unlicense</a>
    attempt to eschew the copyright system altogether, and put work directly into public domain.
    Others like the WTFPL attempt to say "do What The Fuck you want".
    In some places like Germany your copyrights are inalienable and as such these licenses are largely unenforceable
    - not that anyone who published works with these licenses <em>would</em> sue, but,
    it's a distinct possibility (lawyers hate this one weird trick).
</p>

<p>
    (chapter two-point-five...-point-five?: EULAs) <br/>

    So someone's made some software - they have the distribution rights.
    That means if they want to give you a copy, they can apply whatever rules they want,
    so long as those rules aren't illegal. You'll often see these rules in the form of an EULA.
</p>

<p>
    One EULA I'd like to highlight is the (old) Unity Personal EULA, which had the following clause in it:
</p>

<blockquote>
    You will not delete or in any manner alter any Unity or third-party copyright,
    trademark or other proprietary rights notices or markings appearing on or in the Software
    (including the runtime portion thereof).
</blockquote>

<p>
    The TL;DR of this is: don't remove the Unity splash screen if you're on the Personal (free) tier.
    If you do, your permission to use Unity is revoked.
    Following that, if you publish that game, you are now infringing their copyright,
    and could owe them up to $150k in just statutory damages.
    To be slightly clearer, this technically is piracy, which is copyright infringement.
</p>

<p>
    Another case I'd like to look at is Super Mario Maker, where users generate (and own) content,
    but essentially give all rights to that content to Nintendo.
</p>

<blockquote>
    By accepting this Agreement, you give Nintendo permission to use and change your User Generated Content in any way
    and for any purpose for free.
    More specifically, you grant Nintendo and its affiliates and subsidiaries a worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable,
    perpetual, non-exclusive, and sublicenseable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate,
    distribute, perform, and display all or any portion of your User Generated Content,
    and to incorporate your User-Generated Content in other works,
    in any form, media or technology now known or later developed, including for promotional or marketing purposes,
    without any payment to you.
</blockquote>


<p>
    And none of this is particularly unique.
    What I'm getting at is, there's already a precedent set for the tools you use
    defining how you can publish your works (or being able to publish your works however they want).
</p>

// first sale doctrine, pictures of art
// application of digital "copies"

<h4 id="ch2-9-robots"><a href="#ch2-9-robots">chapter two-point-nine: robot art</a></h4>

<p>
    There's a lot of talk about neural networks creating art.
    The general consensus seems to be that whoever uses a tool (such as stable diffusion)
    is the copyright owner for whatever that tool outputs.
</p>

<p>
    There's more I wanted to talk about that didn't really fit the flow of the blog post.
</p>

<blockquote>
    <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ30.pdf">If a work is made for hire,
    the employer or the party that specially ordered or commissioned that work is the initial owner of the copyright in
    the work unless the employer or the commissioning party has signed a written agreement to the contrary
    with the work's creator.
