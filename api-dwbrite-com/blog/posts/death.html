<i>The year is 2012/2013.</i><br/>
I'm a freshman in high school learning computer science.
It's difficult at first, but I get the hang of it soon enough.
Over the summer I make a "2D game engine" using Java's AWT.
Unknowingly, I write a CPU fragment shader. It doesn't perform well.
</p>

<p>
<i>The year is 2013/2014.</i><br/>
I'm in Computer Science II and I'm ahead of the class.
I finish assignments quickly and help the other students when appropriate.
I think this is what I want to do for a living.

<i>The year is 2019.</i><br/>
I've been writing software for the past ~7 years of my life in school and as a hobby.
I live in Munich.
I work at a company where I write backend services to prevent unauthorized feature usage on our scanners.
The android team fails to validate whether a device can be hardware identified over bluetooth.
The project fails there, and I am left in limbo.
We get a new VP of software.
I suggest we should <em>enable</em> our users instead of inhibiting them.
We start working on that. I excel here. I am happy.
</p>

<p>
At the end of my internship, I return to the U.S. to finish my Associate's degree.

<i>The year is 2020.</i><br/>
I've been writing software for the past ~8 years of my life in school, as a hobby,
and I have 6 months of work experience under my belt.
I start looking for work. There is nothing.
</p>

<p>
Three months pass. Quarantine. <br/>
The happiness is fading.
</p>

<p>
I decide to go back to school to pursue a Bachelor's in math. <br/>
I do well online in accelerated differential calculus and a 200-level computer science class.
I go for another semester. Depression hits hard.
I'm digging myself deeper into debt.
I don't actually care about the degree, I just want to start my career.
</p>

<p>
I fail all my classes.
</p>

<p>
<i>The year is 2021.</i><br/>
I've been writing software for the past ~9 years of my life in school, as a hobby,
and I have 6 months of work experience under my belt.
I apply for hundreds of jobs.
I interview with twenty.
Nothing works out.
</p>

<p>
A friend suggests I apply at his company for a software-adjacent position. I do.
The company thinks I might not be content in a software-adjacent role.
They video call me for the rejection. I cry after we hang up.
</p>

<p>
I write an in-depth blog post about some feature in a niche programming language.
In a few days it hits about 15k gross page views.
From this, I interview with two more companies. Neither work out.
Everyone wants more experience.
</p>

<p>
I push carts and scrub toilets to pay my bills. <br/>
I want to kill myself... But I don't tell anyone.
</p>

<p>
I save up enough to survive a few months, then quit.
I take a short break, then apply at my old company.
There's so much pressure to succeed.
I bungle the programming challenge due to nerves and an unfamiliarity with the current ecosystem.
They reject me.
</p>

<i>The year is 2022.</i><br/>
I've been writing software for the past ~10 years of my life in school, as a hobby,
and I have 6 months of work experience under my belt.
My debts are catching up to me.
I apply to more jobs. Most want more experience.
Internships are only for current/returning students.
Is this the death of the self-taught programmer?
</p>

<p>
Through all this I specialize in subjects whose careers require more education or experience.
Oops.
</p>

<p>
I feel lost. Hopeless... <br/>
I write this blog post.
</p>

<p>
The year is 2022... Maybe I'll find a job soon.
